									<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
									<p>When creating apps for Android using C# it may be a good idea to test the program on phones as much as possible.
									It may be faster to compile the program using the webcam in Unity, but we discovered that the program may behave differently when run on a phone.
									In particular, smog particles moved and looked a certain way on computers, but quite different on phones. It is unclear why the visuals were 
									that different, but the strange movement could be explained by that the phone had less computational power. Assuming that the phones CPU was
									slow, it would take a long time for particles to change direction or react to its environment, like wind from a fan.</p>

									<h2>Related Work</h2>
									<p>"Vuforia with OpenCV for Unity Example". This includes examples done with the Vuforia engine. The code is freely available
									on GitHub.</p>
									<p>"Cultivating Environmental Awareness: Modeling Air Quality Data Via Augmented Reality Miniature Trees". This paper discuss the use of AR in
									an app to visualize poor air quality. They came to the conclusion that there are elements from environmental issues that can be gamified.
									</p>

									<h2>Challanges</h2>
									<p>It was hard to make the game balanced. There was just too many parameters to keep track of in real time. The main focus
									of this project was supposed to be graphics and interaction, so there was not enough room available to make the game sensible.
									To mitigate this kind of problem in future projects, it is very important to acknowledge the scope of the project and its use cases.
									Because of the fact that there was several people in the group, compromises were made to make decisions quickly and thus make progress.
									These compromises was part of the reason why this group ended up with a too large scope, that could not be perfected in time.</p>
